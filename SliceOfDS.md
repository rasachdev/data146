# Slice of Data Science 3/24/2021 - Clare Heinbaugh
Clare is sophomore and 1693 scholar at William and Mary. 
This Slice of Data Science lesson was on transfer learning, stacked generalization, and keras. 
Neural network is one tpe of mathcine learning model to classify data. There is a hidden layer, input layer, and output layer. The example used was a naureal network on spotify that could predict the genre. 
Way to build network, each row is an observation and expand it into a verctor and apply weights and updating weights to predict power of model better. If you want to know how good model, you watnt to do a train test split. you can see how accurate it is by applying data you didn't train the data on. 

Neural networks inckude inlear algebra
kera = pythin library  that does linear algebra. does vectorized operations
Input passes through hidden layer

Convolutional Neurla networks. Example of putting tomato into a vector because its made up of color bands. Identify important features of the image and apply weights to the features. Cold also split by the colors like in the photo of hte tomato split it b reg green and blue. the top box didnt have any red

Tranfer Learning - used to allow us to take wights trained to recognixe images and apply them to our own problem. Apply them and use them to new images. 
Example she used: predict road quality from satelite imagery. Used model to fit satelite images to the actual road qualityt from the app. 
Decided to train 3 dfferent tranfer learning model from Keras.
