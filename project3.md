# Project 3

## 1. 
For the Charleston Asking Price dataset, the features were beds, baths, and are is square feet and the target was the asking price. The linear regression model's training score was 0.019 and testing score was -0.013. The number of folds I put was 10. The linear regression model performs poorly because the R-Squared values are just so low and far from 1. The model poorly predicts the trainging and testing data. When I increase the folds, the testing score or external validity gets much lower. 

## 2.
With standardizing the features, the linear regression model's training score was 0.019 and testing score was -0.019. The number of folds I put was 10. The scores are basically the same as the previous question's scores. The testing score was a bit lower. The model still performs poorly. And again, with increasing the folds to higher number also decreases the testing score. 

## 3.
With  standardized data in the ridge regression model, the training score was 0.019 and testing score was 0.012 with 10 folds. The training score was the same as the previous question's score. But the model's testing score was imporved rather significantly, performing better to external data. Overall though, the model still performs poorly. When I increase the number of folds, the testing score gets lower.

## 4.
For the Charleston Actual Price dataset, I created 3 the same previous 3 models just with the new data.
