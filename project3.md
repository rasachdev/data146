# Project 3

## 1. 
For the Charleston asking price dataset, the features were beds, baths, and are is square feet and the target was the asking price. The linear regression model's training score was 0.019 and testing score was -0.013. The number of folds I put was 10. The model performs poorly because the scores are not close to 1

## 2.
With standardizing the features, the linear regression model's training score was 0.019 and testing score was -0.007. The number of folds I put was 10. The scores are basically the same as the previous question's scores. The model performs poorly.
