# Project 3

## 1. 
For the Charleston asking price dataset, the features were beds, baths, and are is square feet and the target was the asking price. The linear regression model's training score was 0.019 and testing score was -0.013. The number of folds I put was 10. The model performs poorly because both the scores are not close to 1. 

## 2.
With standardizing the features, the linear regression model's training score was 0.020 and testing score was -0.019. The number of folds I put was 10. The scores are basically the same as the previous question's scores. The model still performs poorly. 

## 3.
With the linear regression model's training score was 0.019 and testing score was 0.015. The training score was basically the same as the previous question's score. But the model's testing score was imporved rather significantly, performing better to external data. Overall though, the model still performs poorly.
