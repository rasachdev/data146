# Project 5 - Part 1

## 1. Data Results on WealthC
First, I set the variable **wealthC** as my target. I then performed a linear regression and computed the mean squared error, MSE. For the MSE, I got 0.44281. Then I standardized the features and again computed the MSE. With that step, I got the same MSE of 0.44281.

For my linear regression, I got a mean training score of 0.7358361818893744 and mean testing score of 0.7350550082046395. I also got a mean MSE trainging score of 0.44278652650445827 and a mean MSE testing score of 0.44375466672109376. When comparing the coefficients of the two models, they are smaller. 

Next I ran a ridge regression. The results I got were an alpha value of 76.0 with a training score of 0.7358363174051512 and a testing score of 0.7350544860652567. 

Then I ran a lasso regression. The results I got were: 0.00026333333333333336 0.7358346356402806 0.7350562589633233

The lasso regression has a higher mean testing score 

## 2. Data Results on WealthI
The next step was changing my  target variable to **wealthI**. I did the same steps as the previous step.
