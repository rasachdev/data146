# Project 5 - Part 1

## 1. WealthC
First, I set the variable wealthC as my target. I then performed a linear regression and computed the mean squared error, MSE. For the MSE, I got 0.44281. Then I standardized the features and again computed the MSE. With that step, I got the same MSE of 0.44281.

When comparing the coefficients of the two models, they are smaller. 

Next I ran a ridge regression. 

Then I ran a lasso regression. 

## 2. WealthI
The next step was changing my  target variable to wealthI. I did the same steps as the previous step. 

## 3. Best Results
