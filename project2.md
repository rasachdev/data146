# Project 2

## 1. 
Continuous data is data that keeps changing or keeps updating. An example of continuous data would be a person's age or a person's height
Ordinal data is data where the order of values but not the difference. An example of ordinal data would be 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place in a race
Nominal data is data that is categorical. Examples of nominal data are countries, occupations, or genders

A model of my own construction is a randomly selected group of people which I would ask to run in a 5k race. Before the race, I would ask for people's ages and their genders. Their ages would be the continuous data. Their genders would be the nominal data. Their placement at the end of completing the 5K would be the ordinal data.

### Normal Distribution
![](normal.PNG)

Mean: 0.496

Median: 0.499


### Left Skewed Distribution
![](left.PNG)

Mean: 0.909

Median: 0.933

### Right Skewed Distribution
![](right.PNG)

Mean: 0.093

Median: 0.070

As the alpha value becomes larger, we can see that the bulk of the distribution shift more towrd the right and as the beta becomes smaller, we can see that the distribution moves more toward the left.

### Raw Data

### Log Transformation Data
![](loglifeexp.PNG)

Of the two resulting plots, the log transformation data plot best communicates the change in life expectancy amongst all of the countries from 1952 to 2007. We are able to clearly see the differences between the two years with the overlapping histogram produced with the log transformation. There is an upward trend that is detectable. The first data shows no real trend as opposed to the log transformation data.

### Raw Box & Whisker

### Log Transformation Box & Whisker
![](logbox.PNG)

Of the two resulting plots, the log transformation box and whisker plot clearly best communicates the change in population amongst all of these countries from 1952 to 2007. We are able to clearly see the boxplots and their values on the log transformation plot which we are unable to see on the raw data plot. It is way more spread out and readable for us to clearly analyze the data. The first plot is way too squished together with large outliers to loo see anything.
